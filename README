P-8 is a server component for providing realtime data push over HTTP. Web
applications that need HTTP long-polling or HTTP streaming interfaces simply
place P-8 in front of them on the network path, in much the same way you
might put a load balancer in front. P-8 handles the long-lived connection
wrangling and communicates with the application using normal request/response
HTTP. This means the application can be written in any language and use any
webserver.

Additionally, P-8 does all of this without exposing a proprietary protocol
to clients. The HTTP content between the client and your server is whatever
you want it to be. This makes it ideal for writing APIs.

License:

  - P-8 is offered under the GNU AGPL. See the COPYING file.

Features:

  - Implement any realtime HTTP API using any webserver for the logic
  - Proxied requests are streamed, so non-realtime requests remain unhindered
  - Fault tolerant dual-process design reduces risk if things go wrong
  - Handle thousands of simultaneous connections (thanks to Mongrel2)

Requirements:

  qt >= 4.7
  libzmq >= 2.0
  qjson
  mongrel2
  zurl
  python
  python tnetstring
  python zmq

If accessing from Git, be sure to pull submodules:

  git submodule init
  git submodule update

Build:

  cd proxy
  ./configure
  make
  cd ..

Run:

  There are two processes.

  Proxy process:
    proxy/p-8-proxy --verbose --config=p-8.conf.example

  Handler process:
    python handler/p-8-handler.py --config=p-8.conf.example

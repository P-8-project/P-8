P-8 is an HTTP reverse proxy server that makes it easy to implement
streaming and long-polling services. It communicates with backend web
applications using regular, short-lived HTTP requests (GRIP protocol). This
allows the backend applications to be written in any language and use any
webserver.

Additionally, P-8 does all of this without exposing a proprietary protocol
to clients. The HTTP content between the client and your server is whatever
you want it to be. This makes it ideal for implementing APIs.

License:

  - P-8 is offered under the GNU AGPL. See the COPYING file.

Features:

  - Implement any realtime HTTP API using any webserver for the logic
  - Proxied requests are streamed, so non-realtime requests remain unhindered
  - Fault tolerant dual-process design reduces risk if things go wrong
  - Handle thousands of simultaneous connections (thanks to Mongrel2)

Requirements:

  qt >= 4.7
  libzmq >= 2.0
  qjson
  mongrel2
  zurl
  python
  python setproctitle
  python tnetstring
  python zmq

If accessing from Git, be sure to pull submodules:

  git submodule init
  git submodule update

Build:

  cd proxy
  ./configure
  make
  cd ..

Run:

  runner/p-8-runner --config=p-8.conf.example

  P-8 consists of 4 processes: mongrel2, zurl, p-8-proxy, and
  p-8-handler. P-8-runner launches them all in one shot.

  If you'd prefer to individually manage any of these processes yourself, then
  adjust the "services" field in p-8.conf. You can even choose to not use
  the runner at all. In that case, P-8's own processes can be launched
  as follows:

  Proxy process:
    proxy/p-8-proxy --verbose --config=p-8.conf.example

  Handler process:
    handler/p-8-handler --config=p-8.conf.example

Test:

  By default, P-8 listens on port 7999 and forwards to localhost port 80.
  If you've got a webserver running on port 80, you can confirm that proxying
  works by browsing to http://localhost:7999/
